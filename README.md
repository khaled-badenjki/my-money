MyMoney is a platform that lets investors track their consolidated portfolio value across equity, debt, and gold. It also lets them perform various operations on their portfolio, such as rebalancing, SIP, etc.

# Setup :rocket:
## 1. Using Docker :whale:

 Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` file 
 
    cp .env.example .env

Then run docker compose with this command

    docker-compose up --build -d 

    
   Once the build is done, you can start interacting with the tool. To see a list of available commands, do this:
   

    docker-compose run app node index.js --help



> when dealing with long commands like this, I like to create an alis to make my life easier. So i encourage you to create an alias called `mm` (for MyMoney):
> `alias mm='docker-compose run app node index.js'`
> Now you can interact with the tool like this
> `mm --help`

If this is the **first time** to run the app, you will need to create the database and run migrations. Do the following:

    docker-compose run app npx sequelize-cli db:create
    docker-compose run app npx sequelize-cli db:migrate

And you are ready to go :rocket:
   
## 2. Without Docker :gear:
For the application, you will need `yarn` to be installed. Run this command to install dependencies

    yarn

Once finished, copy `.env.example` to `.env`

    cp .env.example .env
    
You will need to update the environment variable `POSTGRES_HOST` inside `.env` to be `localhost` instead of `db`

    # POSTGRES_HOST=db
    POSTGRES_HOST=localhost # new value

At this stage, the application is ready to use. However, you still need a `postgresql` instance.

If you don't want to install `postgresql` locally (which is a right decision), then you can use `Docker`  to handle the database while keeping the application without `Docker` (this is my preferable approach while developing)


It would look something like this:

    docker run --name postgresql -e POSTGRES_USER=user -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pass -p 5432:5432 -v /data:/var/lib/postgresql/data -d postgres
   
Once the app and database are up and running, you will need to create the database and run the migrations:

    npx sequelize-cli db:create
    npx sequelize-cli db:migrate

   After that, you should be ready to go :rocket:

# Testing üß™
To run the test suite, run this command:

    docker compose run app yarn coverage

### Notes

 - I followed **TDD** approach, while keeping an eye on high test coverage (currently it's at 100%)
 - I followed **Trunk Based Development**, by utilizing the `main` branch. To ensure no broken code is pushed to remote, I made use of [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) package to implement a `pre-push` hook, that runs the test suite and only proceed if it's green (it also runs lint as a `pre-commit` hook)
 - I have used [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) for testing, [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) for assertion, [sinon](https://sinonjs.org/releases/latest/stubs/) for stubbing and [nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc) for code coverage.
 - to implement e2e tests, I used `sqlite` to run tests quickly, in memory, without the need to setup a postgresql instance. `sequelize` ORM helped make the code working on both databases without the need for modification

# Design üìê‚úèÔ∏è
## Layered Architecture

![Layered Architecture](./docs/images/layered-architecture.png)

I followed the layered architecture approach, where each layer has a specific responsibility. This approach helps to keep the code clean and easy to maintain. It also helps to keep the code testable, as each layer can be tested in isolation.

### Presentation Layer (Commands)
This layer is responsible for interacting with the user. It's the entry point of the application. It's also responsible for validating and parsing the user input, then passing it to the business layer. 

### Business Layer (Services)
This layer is responsible for the business logic. It's the heart of the application. It's responsible for orchestrating the data flow between the data layer and the presentation layer.

### Data Access Layer (DAL)
This layer is responsible for interacting with the database. It's responsible for creating the database connection, defining the database schema, and providing an interface for the business layer to interact with the database.

### Helpers
This part is not a layer per se, but it's a collection of helper functions that are used across the application. It's responsible for providing utility functions that are used by the presentation layer.

## Database Schema
![Database Schema](./docs/images/db-schema.png)

I used `sequelize` ORM to define the database schema. I used `postgresql` as a database engine. I used `sequelize-cli` to create the database and run migrations.

# Usage ‚≠ê
when passing a negative value (for example the `CHANGE` command), you need to pass double dash `--` to signify the end of options, so it would be like this

    node index.js CHANGE -- 10.00% 8.00% -5.00% JUNE
    



# Performance üìä


# Limitations üèãüèΩ

 - This software deals with one year only (it's assumed to be `2023`, but this can be easily changed from `config.js` file). It should be relatively easy to extend it to handle multiple years.
